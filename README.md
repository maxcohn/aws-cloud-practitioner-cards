I made physical flash cards when I studied for my AWS Cloud Practitioner exam in February of 2023.
I studied though ExamPro's course (which is all available on YouTube) and I paid something like $25 for their practice exams and I thought that those were a great resource.

The course changes over time, but I'd imagine the fundementals will stay the same.
I had an old coworker as to borrow my flashcards but alas we lived across the country from each other.
I figured more people could benefit from these being out in the public.

I do not guarantee that these cards are correct, well formed, or cover the entire course.
These are just the things I used to study and they helped me pass the exam.
These also probably aren't a replacement for studying completely, but hopefully they can be a study assistant after a more traditional course has been done.
